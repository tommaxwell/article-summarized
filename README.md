This project utilizes the Clipped API (http://clipped.me/api.html) to create a web interface for summarizing articles from across the web. It's
a work in progress.

Due to lack of JSONP support by the Clipped API endpoint, it is recommended that you reverse-proxy the API locally to avoid cross-domain issues. I highly recommend the mod_proxy plugin if you're using Apache.
